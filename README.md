Graceful degradation and service workers both help keep a website working when things don’t go as planned. With graceful degradation, the website starts with full features but still works if some features don’t load or aren’t supported. Service workers do something similar by saving files and data so that the website can still work without the internet. This helps users still use the app even with a weak or no connection.
